  <em>How it started</em> :
  <br>
  <br>
  The website is the final step in our 6months-long-project for JohnBryce academy,<br>
   it has started as a simple java-based system and since then it has matured<br>
    into a content-filled, displayable website.
<br>
<br>

<em>The development:</em>
<br>
  <br>Stage 1 : building the project using Java's base technologies<br>
  In this step we were relatively new to Java and encountered 2 issues: the first:  was that
  we had no expirience creating a new system, and the entire project had to be written from the ground up,
  while hestitaing (alot!) we wrote the project's base as well as we could and made our first design decisions in the process!<br>
  the second problem was that we knew we were designing a connection to the database that is going to be changed alot during our next phase.

  <br>
  <em>Stage 2 : </em><br> : Converting the entire project to work using Spring's principles<br>
  This stage was all about making our system more efficient, Spring had a lot of built-in aids that had improved
  our system, including the repositories, that allow easier access to the db, and had a functionality of "derived functions"
  which helped alot, we built Services to hold all of our system's logic, and Facades which rallied the various classes' behaviours
  in a simple class format, using Spring has greatly helped our communication with the database, and have "saved" us a lot of
  time (and code lines) while operating our system.


  <br><em>Stage 3 :</em> <br>using an Angular-Spring mixture to create both<br>
  the Server-Side(backEnd) and Client-Side(FrontEnd)
  In this step we infused the Angular Technology into our project, we built a Client-Side website to communicate with our server
  this step was especially difficult because after all our time spent on learning Java, this part was actually written in TypeScript
